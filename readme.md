# Quantum Translate

*A Modern, Fast Translation Extension for Firefox (with unofficial Chromium support)*

Quantum Translate harnesses the principles of quantum efficiency—where every operation is optimized for maximum performance with minimal overhead. Just as quantum systems achieve states impossible in classical physics, this extension achieves translation speeds and simplicity that traditional tools cannot match. With a streamlined interface that eliminates the "observer effect" of cluttered designs, it delivers translations that feel instantaneous and natural.

## Key Highlights

- **Quantum-Inspired Design:** A clean, interference-free interface that maintains coherence across your browsing experience, avoiding the decoherence that plagues cluttered translation tools.
- **Superposition Performance:** Like quantum particles existing in multiple states simultaneously, Quantum Translate processes translations across multiple pathways for unprecedented speed.
- **Entangled Translation:** Text and meaning remain perfectly synchronized across languages, maintaining the original context without information loss.
- **Flexible Quantum States:**
    - Choose your target language with precision
    - Switch between translation engines (Google or Yandex) instantaneously
    - Enable automatic translation that adapts to your browsing patterns

## Privacy and Permissions

- Access to site content follows the quantum principle of minimal necessary interaction—only the text requiring translation is processed.
- No personal data undergoes "measurement" or storage by the extension, preserving your privacy state.
- Translation engines receive only the essential information needed, following quantum mechanics' principle of conservation.

Note: Certain quantum-protected sites, such as `addons.mozilla.org` and `support.mozilla.org`, maintain their original state due to browser security protocols.

## Installation

1. Download the latest release from the releases section.
2. Install through your browser's extension manager. Firefox operates at full quantum efficiency, with Chromium compatibility available for advanced users exploring cross-platform quantum states.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**What makes Quantum Translate different from classical translation tools?**
While classical translators operate linearly, Quantum Translate processes information in parallel states, delivering results that feel instantaneous and maintaining perfect coherence between original and translated content.

**Why does it request access to all websites?**
Like quantum field theory requires access to all possible states, the extension needs universal access to translate any webpage while maintaining system integrity.

**Does the extension observe or track my behavior?**
No. Following Heisenberg's principle, we avoid observation that would disturb your natural browsing state. The extension maintains quantum anonymity—your data exists in a superposition of privacy that remains unmeasured.
